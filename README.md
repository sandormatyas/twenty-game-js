# twenty-game-js

Twenty game is a game similar to the well known 2048, where you have to shift the board to slide tiles with matching numbers into each other creating a new tile with their sum. In our version you have to move tiles with the same number into each other with the mouse and they create a new tile with the number one bigger, than them. The goal is to reach 20.
